# GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)

This project trains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items.

# Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a GAN for generating images based on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The GAN architecture consists of:

Generator: Generates new images from random noise.

Discriminator: Distinguishes between real images (from the dataset) and fake images (generated by the generator).
